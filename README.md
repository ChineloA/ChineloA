### 💪 IronCore Fitness
*Comprehensive Fitness Performance Dashboard*
[← Previous](#-retail-edge) • [Back to TOC](#-main-table-of-contents) 

![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Power%20BI-yellow?style=plastic&logo=powerbi)

#### 🧩 Problem Statement  
As IronCore Fitness expands its client base, training programs, and membership tiers across multiple locations, the management team struggles to gain a unified, real-time view of member distribution, trainer performance, and overall fitness engagement.  

The current dependence on static reports makes it challenging to track membership growth, identify underutilized services, or analyze patterns in client retention and churn. This limits data-driven decision-making in membership management, trainer allocation, and program development.  

To address this, IronCore Fitness requires a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** that visualizes critical business and fitness metrics across multiple dimensions.


#### 📊 Dashboard Overview  
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of:
- 💼 **Revenue Insights** – Monthly revenue, profit, and expense trends  
- 🧍‍♂️ **Client Tracking** – Active vs inactive clients, trainer allocation, and goal monitoring  
- 💳 **Membership Plans** – Distribution of Platinum, Gold, and Silver memberships  
- 📅 **Engagement Metrics** – Monthly sign-ups and client activity patterns  
- ⏱ **Performance Monitoring** – Progress tracking via expiry and activity rates

### 🧱 PrimeMart  
*PrimeMart Retail — Sales & Customer Analytics in Microsoft Fabric (OneLake, SQL, Power BI)* 
[Back to TOC](#-main-table-of-contents) • [Next →](#-nyc-yellow-taxi)  
**Company / Context:** PrimeMart Retail Ltd. (Omnichannel Retail)

![Microsoft Fabric](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Microsoft%20Fabric-blue?style=plastic&logo=microsoft-fabric)(OneLake, Lakehouse), SQL Endpoint, Data Factory (pipelines), Power BI, Notebooks (optional)

**📌 Problem Statement**  
PrimeMart’s data is fragmented across daily Excel exports (sales), manual inventory updates, and siloed customer feedback databases. This causes:  
- **Delayed reporting** — insights arrive weekly/monthly instead of real-time.  
- **Data inconsistency** — conflicting sales/revenue/stock figures across departments.  
- **Limited analytics** — difficult to spot top sellers, buying trends, or stock shortages.  
- **Reactive decisions** — missed opportunities to optimise pricing, promotions, and inventory.  

**🎯 Project Aim**  
Build a **single source of truth in Microsoft Fabric** to enable real-time, consistent, and actionable analytics across sales, inventory, and customer behaviour.

**🛠️ Approach**  
**Data Architecture (Medallion):**  
- **Bronze (Raw):** Land source files in **OneLake** (store sales, inventory, customer feedback).  
- **Silver (Cleaned):** Standardise schemas, fix types/keys, deduplicate records.  
- **Gold (Analytics-Ready):** Star/Snowflake models for Sales, Inventory, Customers, Products.

**Pipelines & Models:**  
- Orchestrate ingestion with **Data Factory** (scheduled/triggered).  
- Transform with **Notebooks / Dataflows Gen2** to enforce business rules & SCD where needed.  
- Expose **SQL Endpoint** for governed, fast analytics.

**🔎 SQL Analytics (Fabric SQL Endpoint)**  
**Queries to power executive reporting and self-service BI:**

- **Top 10 Products by Revenue**
 ```sql
 SELECT TOP 10
    p.Product_Name,
    round(sum(s.Total_Amount),2) As Total_Revenue
FROM sales_table s
JOIN products_table p on s.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY p.Product_Name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```

- **Monthly Revenue Trend**
```sql
SELECT
    MONTH(s.Date) as MONTH,
    round(sum(s.Total_Amount),2) As Total_Revenue
FROM sales_table s
GROUP BY MONTH(s.Date)
order BY Total_Revenue desc;
```

```

-**Repeat VS One-Time Customers (One line each)**
```sql
WITH orders_per_customer AS (
  SELECT
      s.Customer_ID,
      COUNT(DISTINCT s.Sale_ID)              AS num_orders,
      SUM(CAST(s.Total_Amount AS float))     AS revenue  -- or s.line_total

### 🚕 NYC Yellow Taxi  
*Optimizing Urban Mobility — NYC Yellow Taxi Analytics Dashboard using Fabric*
[← Previous](#-primemart) • [Back to TOC](#-main-table-of-contents)
**Company / Context:** Public Data Case Study (NYC Yellow Taxi Dataset)  

![Microsoft Fabric](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Microsoft%20Fabric-blue?style=plastic&logo=microsoft-fabric)(OneLake, Lakehouse, SQL Endpoint, Power BI)  

**📌 Problem Statement**  
The New York City taxi industry generates massive amounts of trip data daily. However, without a unified analytics pipeline, extracting meaningful insights is challenging. This results in:  
- **Missed insights** — difficulty identifying peak travel demand across time and zones.  
- **Inefficient operations** — lack of clear visibility into revenue, trip lengths, and customer demand patterns.  
- **Fragmented reporting** — raw trip data is not optimised for decision-making or interactive reporting.  

**🎯 Project Aim**  
Leverage Microsoft Fabric to build an **end-to-end analytics solution** that ingests, processes, and visualises NYC Yellow Taxi trip data to uncover trends in urban mobility and support transportation planning.  

**🛠️ Approach**  
**Data Architecture (Medallion):**  
- **Bronze (Raw):** Ingest raw taxi trip CSV/parquet data into **OneLake**.  
- **Silver (Cleaned):** Clean schema, fix outliers (e.g., negative fares/distances), standardise timestamps.  
- **Gold (Analytics-Ready):** Create aggregated fact tables for **Trips, Revenue, Zones, and Time**.  

**Data Processing & Queries:**  
- Use **SQL Endpoint / Lakehouse SQL Editor** for analysis and transformations.  
- Build summarised tables/views for Power BI dashboards.  

**🔎 SQL Analytics (Fabric SQL Endpoint)**  
**Queries to support reporting and insights:**  

-**What is the Total No of Trips?**
```sql
SELECT trip_year, trip_month, COUNT(*) AS Total_Trips
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY trip_year, trip_month
ORDER BY Total_Trips DESC;
```

-**What is the Total Revenue by Month?**
```sql
SELECT trip_month,ROUND(SUM(total_amount),2) AS Revenue
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY trip_month
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
```

-**What is the Average Fare Amount by Month?**
```sql
SELECT trip_month,ROUND(AVG(fare_amount),2) AS Avg_fare
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY trip_month
ORDER BY Avg_fare DESC;
```

-**Where are the Most Frequent Pickup Zones?**
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 PU_Zone, COUNT(*) AS Pickup_Count
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY PU_Zone
ORDER BY Pickup_Count DESC;
```

-**What is the trip distribution by hour of the day?**
```sql
SELECT pickup_hour, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY pickup_hour
ORDER BY trip_count desc;
```

-**What is the distribution of payment methods?**
```sql
SELECT Payment_method, COUNT(*) AS Payment_count
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY Payment_method
ORDER BY Payment_count desc;
```

-**What is the average tip amount per hour?**
```sql
SELECT pickup_hour, round(avg(tip_amount), 2) AS avg_tip
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY pickup_hour
ORDER BY avg_tip DESC;
```

-**Are there trips with suspicious or negative fares?**
