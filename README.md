### 🧱 PrimeMart  
*PrimeMart Retail — Sales & Customer Analytics in Microsoft Fabric (OneLake, SQL, Power BI)* 
[Back to TOC](#-main-table-of-contents) • [Next →](#-nyc-yellow-taxi)  
**Company / Context:** PrimeMart Retail Ltd. (Omnichannel Retail)  
**Tool(s):** Microsoft Fabric (OneLake, Lakehouse), SQL Endpoint, Data Factory (pipelines), Power BI, Notebooks (optional)

**📌 Problem Statement**  
PrimeMart’s data is fragmented across daily Excel exports (sales), manual inventory updates, and siloed customer feedback databases. This causes:  
- **Delayed reporting** — insights arrive weekly/monthly instead of real-time.  
- **Data inconsistency** — conflicting sales/revenue/stock figures across departments.  
- **Limited analytics** — difficult to spot top sellers, buying trends, or stock shortages.  
- **Reactive decisions** — missed opportunities to optimise pricing, promotions, and inventory.  

**🎯 Project Aim**  
Build a **single source of truth in Microsoft Fabric** to enable real-time, consistent, and actionable analytics across sales, inventory, and customer behaviour.

**🛠️ Approach**  
**Data Architecture (Medallion):**  
- **Bronze (Raw):** Land source files in **OneLake** (store sales, inventory, customer feedback).  
- **Silver (Cleaned):** Standardise schemas, fix types/keys, deduplicate records.  
- **Gold (Analytics-Ready):** Star/Snowflake models for Sales, Inventory, Customers, Products.

**Pipelines & Models:**  
- Orchestrate ingestion with **Data Factory** (scheduled/triggered).  
- Transform with **Notebooks / Dataflows Gen2** to enforce business rules & SCD where needed.  
- Expose **SQL Endpoint** for governed, fast analytics.

**🔎 SQL Analytics (Fabric SQL Endpoint)**  
**Queries to power executive reporting and self-service BI:**

- **Top 10 Products by Revenue**
 ```sql
 SELECT TOP 10
    p.Product_Name,
    round(sum(s.Total_Amount),2) As Total_Revenue
FROM sales_table s
JOIN products_table p on s.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY p.Product_Name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```

- **Monthly Revenue Trend**
```sql
SELECT
    MONTH(s.Date) as MONTH,
    round(sum(s.Total_Amount),2) As Total_Revenue
FROM sales_table s
GROUP BY MONTH(s.Date)
order BY Total_Revenue desc;
```

    ON c.Customer_ID = s.Customer_ID
    GROUP BY c.Customer_ID
    HAVING COUNT(distinct s.Sale_ID) =1
```

-**Repeat VS One-Time Customers (One line each)**
```sql

      s.Customer_ID,
      COUNT(DISTINCT s.Sale_ID)              AS num_orders,

  AVG(o.revenue)                           AS avg_revenue_per_customer
FROM orders_per_customer AS o
GROUP BY CASE WHEN o.num_orders = 1 THEN 'One-time' ELSE 'Repeat' END

 AND s.Store_ID   = i.Store_ID
GROUP BY

### 🚕 NYC Yellow Taxi  
*Optimizing Urban Mobility — NYC Yellow Taxi Analytics Dashboard using Fabric*
[← Previous](#-primemart) • [Back to TOC](#-main-table-of-contents)
**Company / Context:** Public Data Case Study (NYC Yellow Taxi Dataset)  
**Tool(s):** Microsoft Fabric (OneLake, Lakehouse, SQL Endpoint, Power BI)  

**📌 Problem Statement**  
The New York City taxi industry generates massive amounts of trip data daily. However, without a unified analytics pipeline, extracting meaningful insights is challenging. This results in:  
- **Missed insights** — difficulty identifying peak travel demand across time and zones.  
- **Inefficient operations** — lack of clear visibility into revenue, trip lengths, and customer demand patterns.  
- **Fragmented reporting** — raw trip data is not optimised for decision-making or interactive reporting.  

**🎯 Project Aim**  
Leverage Microsoft Fabric to build an **end-to-end analytics solution** that ingests, processes, and visualises NYC Yellow Taxi trip data to uncover trends in urban mobility and support transportation planning.  

**🛠️ Approach**  
**Data Architecture (Medallion):**  
- **Bronze (Raw):** Ingest raw taxi trip CSV/parquet data into **OneLake**.  
- **Silver (Cleaned):** Clean schema, fix outliers (e.g., negative fares/distances), standardise timestamps.  
- **Gold (Analytics-Ready):** Create aggregated fact tables for **Trips, Revenue, Zones, and Time**.  

**Data Processing & Queries:**  
- Use **SQL Endpoint / Lakehouse SQL Editor** for analysis and transformations.  
- Build summarised tables/views for Power BI dashboards.  

**🔎 SQL Analytics (Fabric SQL Endpoint)**  
**Queries to support reporting and insights:**

```sql
SELECT trip_year, trip_month, COUNT(*) AS Total_Trips
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY trip_year, trip_month
ORDER BY Total_Trips DESC;
```

-**What is the Total Revenue by Month?**
```sql
SELECT trip_month,ROUND(SUM(total_amount),2) AS Revenue
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY trip_month
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
```

-**What is the Average Fare Amount by Month?**
```sql
SELECT trip_month,ROUND(AVG(fare_amount),2) AS Avg_fare
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY trip_month
ORDER BY Avg_fare DESC;
```

-**Where are the Most Frequent Pickup Zones?**
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 PU_Zone, COUNT(*) AS Pickup_Count
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY PU_Zone
ORDER BY Pickup_Count DESC;
```

-**What is the trip distribution by hour of the day?**
```sql
SELECT pickup_hour, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY pickup_hour
ORDER BY trip_count desc;
```

-**What is the distribution of payment methods?**
```sql
SELECT Payment_method, COUNT(*) AS Payment_count
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY Payment_method
ORDER BY Payment_count desc;
```

-**What is the average tip amount per hour?**
```sql
SELECT pickup_hour, round(avg(tip_amount), 2) AS avg_tip
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_enriched
GROUP BY pickup_hour
ORDER BY avg_tip DESC;
