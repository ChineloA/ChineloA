[← Previous](#-nextgen) • [Back to TOC](#-main-table-of-contents) • [Next →](#-alibert-furnitures)

![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-SQL-336791?style=plastic&logo=postgresql)


### 🧩 Problem Statement  
Lewis’ retail database captured detailed order and product data but lacked pricing consistency, missing values, and sales insight. Management needed to:  
- Understand **revenue by product category**,  
- Apply **tiered discount logic**, and  
- Identify **top-selling products** and overall order patterns.  


### 🎯 Project Aim  
Design **SQL queries** to calculate total and discounted revenue, detect missing data, and evaluate sales activity for business performance tracking.  


### 🛠️ Approach  
- Developed conditional pricing rules with **CASE statements** for 10% / 5% discount tiers.  
- Applied **COALESCE** to handle NULL prices and prevent missing revenue totals.  
- Filtered orders by **date ranges** (e.g., 2015) to generate period-specific reports.  
- Used **aggregate and join logic** to rank top products and identify never-ordered items.  


### 📊 Focus & What this shows  
**Focus:** Revenue | Discount Tiers | Product Performance | Sales Trends  

**What this shows:**  
- **Revenue Breakdown:** Measures category revenue with and without discounts.  
- **Data Quality Control:** Substitutes missing prices with default values for accurate totals.  
- **Order Volume:** Tracks total number of orders and activity by year.  
- **Top Sellers:** Lists best-selling products and total quantities ordered.  
- **Unpurchased Items:** Detects products that never sold, returning friendly fallback text.  
- **Outcome:** Provides reliable pricing, discount, and sales data for business optimization.  


**🔎 SQL Analytics**  
**Queries to support reporting and insights:**  

**Q1) Revenue by product category (with tiered discounts)**
**Business rule:**  
- 10% discount if **Price > 100**  
- 5% discount if **50 ≤ Price ≤ 100**  
- Otherwise no discount

```sql
-- A) Baseline (no discount)
SELECT
  p."ProductCategory",
  SUM(p."Price" * o."Quantity") AS "Revenue"
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o."ProductID" = p."ProductID"
GROUP BY p."ProductCategory"
ORDER BY "Revenue" DESC;

-- B) Tiered discounts applied
SELECT
  p."ProductCategory",
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN p."Price" > 100 THEN p."Price" * 0.90 * o."Quantity"
      WHEN p."Price" BETWEEN 50 AND 100 THEN p."Price" * 0.95 * o."Quantity"
      ELSE p."Price" * o."Quantity"
    END
  ) AS "DiscountedRevenue"
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o."ProductID" = p."ProductID"
GROUP BY p."ProductCategory"
ORDER BY "DiscountedRevenue" DESC;
```

**Q2) ||What is the total revenue generated**
**Business rule: If a product’s Price is NULL, treat it as $10.**
```sql
select sum(coalesce("Price", 10) * "Quantity")
from orders
join products on orders. "ProductID" = products. "ProductID";

-- OR 
select sum(coalesce(products."Price", 10) *orders."Quantity") as "TotalRevenue"
from orders
join products on orders. "ProductID" = products. "ProductID";
```

**Q4) Top-selling product in 2015 (by quantity)**
```sql
select "ProductName","ProductCategory", best."TotalQty"
from products
join (select "ProductID",sum("Quantity") as "TotalQty"
from orders
where cast(orders."OrderDate" as date) between '2015-01-01' and '2015-12-31'
group by "ProductID"
order by "TotalQty" DESC
limit 1) best on best."ProductID" = products."ProductID";

**Q5) Average price of products never ordered**
*(returns a friendly message if everything was ordered)*
```sql
select avg("Price")
from products
where "ProductID" not in (
	select distinct "ProductID" from orders
);

select
	coalesce(
		cast(avg ("Price") as text),
		'All Products Were Ordered')
from products
where "ProductID" not in (
	select distinct "ProductID" from orders
);
```

- **Data inconsistency:** Conflicting sales, revenue, and stock figures across departments.  
- **Limited analytics:** Difficult to identify top-performing products, customer buying trends, or inventory shortages.  
- **Reactive decision-making:** By the time insights are available, optimization opportunities are missed.  

These issues create operational confusion, reduce efficiency, and limit PrimeMart’s ability to compete effectively in a fast-changing retail market.  


### 🎯 Project Aim  
To build a **unified analytics solution in Microsoft Fabric** that integrates PrimeMart’s sales, inventory, and customer data into a single, governed environment.

### 2. 🚕 NYC Yellow Taxi  
*Optimizing Urban Mobility — NYC Yellow Taxi Analytics Dashboard using Fabric*
[← Previous](#-primemart) • [Back to TOC](#-main-table-of-contents)
**Company / Context:** Public Data Case Study (NYC Yellow Taxi Dataset)  

![Microsoft Fabric](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Microsoft%20Fabric-blue?style=plastic&logo=microsoft-fabric)(OneLake, Lakehouse, SQL Endpoint, Power BI) 


### 🧩 Problem Statement  
The **New York City Yellow Taxi** fleet generates vast amounts of trip and fare data daily, covering millions of rides across all five boroughs. However, this data often remains **underutilized** due to its raw, unstructured format and lack of unified analytics.  

Without a centralized analytics pipeline, city planners and transport agencies struggle to:  
- Identify **peak travel demand** across time and zones.  
- Understand **revenue and fare patterns** by route or vendor.  
- Analyze **passenger behavior**, payment preferences, and trip durations.  
- Detect **data quality issues** like negative fares or missing values.  

These gaps limit visibility into transportation trends, reduce operational efficiency, and hinder evidence-based decisions for optimizing urban mobility.


### 🎯 Project Aim  
Build a **complete end-to-end data analytics pipeline in Microsoft Fabric** to process, model, and visualize NYC Yellow Taxi trip data — transforming raw trip records into actionable insights that support data-driven transportation planning and revenue optimization.


### 🛠️ Project Tasks & Approach  

#### **1. Data Ingestion & Preparation**  
- Download the **NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data** from the NYC Open Data portal.

#### **2. Data Transformation (Medallion Architecture)**  
- **Bronze Layer (Raw):** Store original trip data as-is.  
- **Silver Layer (Cleaned):** Clean nulls, correct data types, and replace coded columns (e.g., payment type, rate code).  
- **Gold Layer (Analytics-Ready):** Aggregate metrics by time, zone, and vendor for BI reporting.  
- Use **Spark Notebooks and SQL in Fabric** for transformation and schema enforcement.  

#### **3. SQL Analytics (Fabric SQL Endpoint)**  
Run analytical queries to uncover business insights, including:  
- Total trips and revenue by **month**.  
- **Average fare** and **tip amount** per month/hour.  
- **Most frequent pickup zones** and trip distributions by time of day.  
- **Payment method breakdown** and revenue by vendor.  
- Identify **suspicious or negative fares** for data validation.  

#### **4. Visualization in Power BI**  
Build interactive dashboards using **Power BI connected to Fabric** to display:  
- 🚕 **Trip trends** over time (daily/monthly).  
- 🗺️ **Pickup and drop-off zones** by borough.  
- 💳 **Payment method distribution** (cash vs. card).  
- 💰 **Revenue and fare composition** by vendor and rate type.  
- 📊 **Congestion surcharges and airport fee analysis.**  

#### **5. Automation & Workflow Integration**
